The Database project here is a simplification of the actual MatchGuide database.

Scripts included create only the tables and columns that are used by our application up to this point.

It is important to note that in order to get a better understanding of the actual database, you must look at the actual database :)

This database project will need to be maintained and tables and columns will need to be added as features mature and are changed to include additional information.
